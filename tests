# Tests Folder

This folder contains test scripts and resources for validating the TrailService micro-service.

### Planned Files:
1. `test_database.sql`: SQL script to test database integrity and CRUD operations.
2. `test_api.py`: Python script for testing API endpoints (e.g., Postman equivalent).
3. `postman_collection.json`: Postman collection for testing API endpoints.

### Purpose:
The `tests` folder is for managing and organizing test cases to ensure the micro-service works as expected.
