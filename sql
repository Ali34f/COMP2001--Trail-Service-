# SQL Folder

This folder contains all the SQL scripts required for the TrailService micro-service.

### Planned Files:
1. `create_tables.sql`: SQL script to create database tables (e.g., User, Trail, Location).
2. `insert_sample_data.sql`: SQL script to populate tables with sample data for testing.
3. `stored_procedures.sql`: SQL script for stored procedures to handle CRUD operations.
4. `triggers.sql`: SQL script for triggers (e.g., logging trail creation).
5. `views.sql`: SQL script for database views to simplify queries.

### Purpose:
The `sql` folder is dedicated to managing the database structure and functionality.
